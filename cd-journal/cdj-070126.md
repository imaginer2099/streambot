I created a basic directory, initialised git and made a basic shell.nix with an alias for micro so that I can easily create coding journal entries like this one. Mostly doing set up today. Also managed to install a Python313 interpreter with streamlit at the ready.

I developed session for tmux using a .yaml file and tmuxp. Now I can load windows and panes with specific commands and I can also load the session from any directory in my local system.
