Today, I will be populating the llm.py module and creating functions for the tools operation in the OpenAI module.

Decided to switch to the google-genai LLM API. Populated llm.py with a class that has attributes for the model and the client object. Genai has function calling, so I will be implementing that. I just have to figure out the functions that will be called. Since web-scraping prices is a bad idea, I am going to need functions that use online market rates and calculate based on statistical estimates.
